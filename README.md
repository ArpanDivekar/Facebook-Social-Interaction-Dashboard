Used SQL to clean, structure, and extract ad performance data from relational databases.

Created dynamic Power BI visuals including:

Total cost, impressions, link clicks, conversion rate, and reach.

Donut chart for social interactions by ad name.

Bar and column charts for cost vs. ad name and link clicks vs. CPC.

Campaign-level breakdown of page likes, post reactions, impressions, and reach.

Age group analysis and post reaction trends over time.

Enabled filtering by year and age group using slicers for flexible, real-time insights.

Provided actionable insights for campaign optimization and audience targeting.
